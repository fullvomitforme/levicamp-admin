## File Naming, Namespacing, and Conventions

Clean, scalable, explicit

- one-function-per-file: One primary function per file (e.g., `find-threads.ts` for `findMatchingThreads`)
- group-by-feature: Use subfolders for related files (e.g., `threads/find-threads.ts`)
- short-focused-names: Keep names concise, intent-driven (e.g., `process-threads.ts`)
- path-aliases: Use `@/` (e.g., `@/threads/process-threads`)
- no-barrels: Direct imports only (e.g., `./find-threads`, not `./index`)
- consistent-casing: `kebab-case` for files, `PascalCase` for components
- match-export: Filename reflects export (e.g., `Button.tsx` for `export Button`)
- scope-flat-files: Namespace in flat dirs (e.g., `threads-find.ts` if no subfolders)
- shallow-structure: Avoid deep nesting (e.g., `threads/process.ts`, not `threads/process/v1`)
